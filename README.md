We were tasked to try and make a website using Bootstrap of a prototype called Hamster Hotel. We also had to make the site responsive for all devices.
Peer Review: Thao Vang
"the box that houses the "run on the wheel of luxury" is positioned weirdly on my screen, not centered and below where it shouldnt be. cause is probably its absolute positioning. you can use background-img in css to hero img. the "run on the wheel" box is blocking the welcome section. the background for the Our Rooms section and Amenities repeats (can add background norepeat in css). responsiveness is not the best, everything just kind of squishes together without any intentionality. the navbar is basically not responsive. the input field section in reserve room section in tablet resolution (990px-780px) is not very responsive. can center the reserve room section with the input fields at lower pixels. there are ways to fill img without using 100% because it streches the reserve room picture (try set height to certain pixel and using object-fit:cover). suggest using card groups or similar method for cards in the rooms section as they are a bit further apart than shown on the prototype."
